"""Generic async workspace pool with pre-warming and FIFO scheduling.

Designed according to the Pooling Design specification:

* **Lifecycle**: CREATING → POOLED → ACTIVE → RESETTING → POOLED / DESTROYED
  When ``reset_fn`` is ``None``, the RESETTING phase is a no-op and the
  entry proceeds directly to health-check / pause / re-pool.
* **Scheduling**: ``pool_min_ready`` / ``pool_max_ready`` /
  ``pool_capacity`` / ``pool_batch_size`` govern pre-warming and capacity.
* **Maintenance**: A unified background ``_maintain_loop`` keeps the
  ready-to-use (idle) count within the ``[pool_min_ready, pool_max_ready]``
  band.  When the ready count drops below ``pool_min_ready``, new
  instances are created up to ``pool_max_ready``.  When the ready count
  exceeds ``pool_max_ready``, excess instances are drained and destroyed.
  Each workspace also tracks its reuse count; once ``max_reuse`` is
  reached the instance is destroyed instead of recycled.  Health checks
  are performed inline at ``acquire`` and ``release`` time.
* **Overflow fallback**: When the pool has reached ``pool_capacity`` and
  no ready entries are available, ``acquire`` creates an *overflow*
  workspace directly via the factory — bypassing the capacity limit so
  callers are never blocked indefinitely.  On ``release``, overflow
  entries are absorbed into the pool if headroom exists, or destroyed
  outright.
* **FIFO**: Idle workspaces are handed out in the order they became
  available (via :class:`asyncio.Queue`).
* **Cost control**: Idle workspaces are kept in a *paused* state via an
  optional ``pause_fn`` / ``resume_fn`` pair so backends that bill by
  uptime (e.g. E2B) do not accumulate charges while instances sit in
  the pool.

    Args:
        factory: ``async () -> T`` — creates **and initializes** a fresh
            workspace instance. Must return a live, ready-to-use workspace.
        reset_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — resets the workspace to a clean
            state after use. Should restart the gateway, wipe files, etc.
            Called while the workspace is still *running* (before pause).
            ``None`` means no reset is performed on release; the entry
            goes directly to the health-check / pause / re-pool path.
        health_check_fn: ``async (T) -> bool`` — returns ``True`` if the
            workspace is healthy and can be re-pooled after reset.
            Called while the workspace is *running*.
        close_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — permanently destroys the workspace.
        pause_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — suspends the workspace to stop
            billing.  Called when the workspace enters the POOLED state.
            ``None`` means idle workspaces stay running (suitable for
            backends without per-uptime billing).
        resume_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — brings a paused workspace back
            to a running state.  Called when the workspace leaves the
            POOLED state for ACTIVE.  ``None`` means no resume is needed.
        pool_min_ready: Minimum number of ready-to-use (idle) instances
            kept on standby.  When the ready count drops below this
            threshold, the pool automatically creates new instances in
            the background.
        pool_max_ready: Target number of ready-to-use instances after
            replenishment.  The pool will create instances up to this
            count when triggered by a ``pool_min_ready`` breach.
        pool_capacity: Maximum total instances managed by the pool
            (both in-use and standby combined).  Requests beyond this
            limit trigger overflow creation.
        pool_batch_size: How many instances to create concurrently per
            replenishment cycle.
        max_reuse: Maximum times a workspace can be recycled before
            destruction. ``0`` means unlimited.
