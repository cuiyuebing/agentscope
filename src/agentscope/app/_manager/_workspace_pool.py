"""Generic async workspace pool with pre-warming and FIFO scheduling.

Designed according to the Pooling Design specification:

* **Lifecycle**: CREATING → POOLED → ACTIVE → RESETTING → POOLED / DESTROYED
* **Scheduling**: ``min_idle``/``max_idle``/``total``/``create_batch_size``
  govern pre-warming and capacity.
* **Maintenance**: Each workspace tracks its reuse count; once
  ``max_reuse`` is reached the instance is destroyed instead of recycled.
  Health checks are performed inline at ``acquire`` and ``release`` time.
* **FIFO**: Idle workspaces are handed out in the order they became
  available (via :class:`asyncio.Queue`).
* **Cost control**: Idle workspaces are kept in a *paused* state via an
  optional ``pause_fn`` / ``resume_fn`` pair so backends that bill by
  uptime (e.g. E2B) do not accumulate charges while instances sit in
  the pool.

        reset_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — resets the workspace to a clean

            Called while the workspace is still *running* (before pause).
        health_check_fn: ``async (T) -> bool`` — returns ``True`` if the
            workspace is healthy and can be re-pooled after reset.
            Called while the workspace is *running*.
        close_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — permanently destroys the workspace.
        pause_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — suspends the workspace to stop
            billing.  Called when the workspace enters the POOLED state.
            ``None`` means idle workspaces stay running (suitable for
            backends without per-uptime billing).
        resume_fn: ``async (T) -> None`` — brings a paused workspace back
            to a running state.  Called when the workspace leaves the
            POOLED state for ACTIVE.  ``None`` means no resume is needed.
        min_idle: Minimum number of idle instances to maintain. When idle
            count drops below this, the background replenish loop creates
            new instances.
        max_idle: Target idle count after batch replenishment.
